1)	a. applicationWillEnterForeground and sceneWillEnterForeground- This method indicates that app will become active again soon. We can perform state restoration tasks here such as retrieving the stored data.
    applicationDidBecomeActive and sceneDidBecomeActive- This method indicates that our app is completely loaded and is ready to respond to user action.

b. applicationWillResignActive and sceneWillResignActive- This method indicates that our App is going to enter background or is going to get suspended. We can save tasks here.

     applicationDidEnterBackground and sceneDidEnterBackground- - This method indicates that our App has entered the background state.

c. applicationWillResignActive and sceneWillResignActive- This method indicates that our App is going to enter background or is going to get suspended. We can save tasks here.

     applicationDidEnterBackground and sceneDidEnterBackground- This method indicates that our App has entered the background state.


d. applicationDidReceiveMemoryWarning and sceneDidReceiveMemoryWarning- This indicates try to clean up as much memory as possible. 

e. applicationWillTerminate and sceneWillTerminate- Terminate the app.






2)	a. viewDidLoad- The viewDidLoad event is only called when the view is created and loaded into memory 
viewWillAppear- This event notifies the viewController whenever the view appears on the screen.  In this step the view has bounds that are defined but the orientation is not set.

 viewDidAppear- The viewDidAppear event fires after the view is presented on the screen. Which makes it a good place to get data from a backend service or database.

b. viewWillDisappear- The viewWillDisappear event fires when the view of presented viewController is about to disappear, dismiss, cover or hide behind other viewController
viewDidDisappear- This event is fired just after the view disappears.

c. viewWillDisappear- The viewWillDisappear event fires when the view of presented viewController is about to disappear, dismiss, cover or hide behind other viewController
viewDidDisappear- This event is fired just after the view disappears. 

d. viewDidReceiveMemoryWarning- This event is fired when parent application receives a memory warning

3)	Overriden method-
- (void)viewWillTransitionToSize:(CGSize)size withTransitionCoordinator:(id<UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator>)coordinator{
    NSLog(@"coordinator value is  %@ \n ",coordinator);
    NSLog(@"width = %f, height = %f", size.width, size.height);}

Output- 2022-05-01 21:28:17.846686+0530 testProjject1[18332:988320] coordinator value is  <_UIViewControllerTransitionCoordinator: 0x600003896800>

2022-05-01 21:28:17.846888+0530 testProjject1[18332:988320] width = 844.000000, height = 390.000000


When screen is rotated, the size structure parameter contains width and height and coordinator contains the coordinates of the transition






4)App States-			corresponding delegate/life cycle methods
-not running-                 applicationWillTerminate, sceneWillTerminate
-Inactive	                applicationWillEnterForeground, viewDidLoad, viewWillAppear
- Active - 			applicationDidEnterForeground, viewDidDisappear
- Background-		 applicationWillResignActive, applicationDidEnterBackground:
